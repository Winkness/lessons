    the english passage:ALISON AND CLARK
</h1>
<p>
    Allison struggled away from her white Renault, limping with the weight of the last of the pumpkins.<br>
    She found Clark in the twilight4 on the twig-and-leaf-littered porch behind the house.
</p>
<p>
    He wore a wool shawl. He was moving up and back in a padded glider6, pushed by the ball of his slippered7 foot.<br>
    Allison lowered a big pumpkin2, let it rest on the wide floorboards.
</p>
<p>
    Clark was much older-seventy-eight to Allison's thirty-five. <br>
    They were married. <br>
    They were both quite tall and looked something alike in their facial features. 
</p>
<p>
    Allison wore a natural-hair wig5. It was a thick blonde hood8 around her face. <br>
    She was dressed in bright-dyed denims today. <br>
    She wore durable9 clothes, usually, for she volunteered afternoons at a children's daycare center.
